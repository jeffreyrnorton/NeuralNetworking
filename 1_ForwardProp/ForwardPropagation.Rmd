# Forward Propagation

Forward propagation is the process propogating the signal from the
input layer to the output or visual layer.  Here is a three-layer network
which I found on
[Stack Exchange](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/147954/neural-network-forward-propagation) along with how to do the forward propogation.
